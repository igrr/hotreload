// This file is intentionally minimal.
// The hotreload_symbol_table, hotreload_symbol_names, and hotreload_symbol_count
// are defined in the generated reloadable_symbol_table.c file.
//
// The hotreload component populates hotreload_symbol_table by loading the
// reloadable ELF and looking up each symbol in hotreload_symbol_names.
