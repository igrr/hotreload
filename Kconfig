menu "Hot Reload"

    config HOTRELOAD_PARTITION
        string "Partition name for reloadable ELF"
        default "hotreload"
        help
            Name of the flash partition where reloadable ELF files are stored.
            This partition should be defined in your partitions.csv file.

    config HOTRELOAD_COMPONENTS
        string "Reloadable components (semicolon-separated)"
        default ""
        help
            Semicolon-separated list of component names to make reloadable.
            Example: "reloadable;my_module"

            This allows making components reloadable without modifying their
            CMakeLists.txt files. Components listed here will have their source
            files compiled into a reloadable shared library instead of being
            linked into the main application.

            Alternatively, add the RELOADABLE keyword to idf_component_register()
            in the component's CMakeLists.txt.
