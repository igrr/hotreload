# This file is applied when building for real ESP32 hardware

# Disable WiFi by default for basic unit tests
# For E2E tests that need networking, enable in chip-specific sdkconfig.defaults.<chip>
# or create a sdkconfig.local with your WiFi credentials
CONFIG_EXAMPLE_CONNECT_WIFI=n
# Note: CONFIG_EXAMPLE_CONNECT_ETHERNET is set per-chip in sdkconfig.defaults.<chip>

# Disable OpenETH (QEMU-only)
