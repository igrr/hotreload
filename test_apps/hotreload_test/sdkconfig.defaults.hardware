# Hardware-specific configuration
# This file is applied when building for real ESP32 hardware.
# Chip-specific files (sdkconfig.defaults.<chip>) are listed AFTER this file
# in CMakePresets.json, so they can override these settings.

# Disable networking by default for unit tests.
# Chips that need networking for E2E tests (e.g. ESP32-P4 with Ethernet)
# re-enable it in their chip-specific sdkconfig.defaults.<chip>.
# Users can also enable WiFi via sdkconfig.local with their credentials.

# Disable OpenETH (QEMU-only virtual NIC)
