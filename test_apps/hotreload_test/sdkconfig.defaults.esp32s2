# ESP32-S2 specific configuration

# Use UART for console (default for boards with external UART bridge)
# Note: ESP32-S2 USB-Serial/JTAG is available on some boards, but the
# board we're testing with uses an external USB-to-UART bridge on GPIO 43/44.
# So we use the default UART console instead.
# CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_USB_SERIAL_JTAG=y

# NOTE: PSRAM is NOT enabled for ESP32-S2 dynamic code loading.
# ESP32-S2 does not support PSRAM XIP (execute in place) for dynamically loaded
# code. The PSRAM XIP feature requires CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS which
# copies flash code to PSRAM at startup, not runtime dynamic loading.
# On ESP32-S2, code execution from dynamically allocated memory uses internal
# DRAM with D/IRAM overlap (like original ESP32).

# Increase main task stack for test framework
CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE=8192
